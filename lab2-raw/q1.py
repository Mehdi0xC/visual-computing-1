# Todo 1: Calculate element-wise average of A, B, C

# Todo 2: Calculate the following summary statistics for the matrix D:

# Todo 3: Consider a new matrix E obtained by horizontally stacking matrices A, B, and C

# Todo 4: Given a weight vector w, compute the matrix F = w[0] * A + w[1] * B + w[2] * C

# Printing the results
